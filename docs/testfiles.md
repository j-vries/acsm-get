Test Files
----------

For development purposes it is useful to have some acsm files to test with.

You can download free acsm files from Adobe's [Sample e-Book Library](https://www.adobe.com/solutions/ebook/digital-editions/sample-ebook-library.html).

You can borrow free acsm files from the [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/). This requires an account.
